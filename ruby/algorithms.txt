Pseudocode Part 1 Robot using an elevator. Denise Duffy 11/14/16

* Robot you move on your own?

			* No - End program, this is just not going to work.
			* Yes - Continue

* Do you know what and where an elevator is?
			* No - End program, this is just not going to work.
			* Yes - Continue

* Walk or roll in front of the elevator.

* Locate the Up or Down Arrow Buttons.

	* Ask your buddy where you are going, up or down?

	* Listen to their response.
				
	* Use your body, arms, hand, and finger to move towards and press this button. 

* When the doors to the elevator open, roll or walk in, whatever you do.

	* Ask your buddy "what floor are we going to?"

	* Listen to their response.

	* Press the same button as their response.

* When the elevator stops moving, ask this question:

		* Does the elevator floor match the floor requested?

		* If no, wait for the this to be so.

		* If yes, and the door opens, roll or walk out of the elevator.

* Give a high five to your buddy, again, can you even do that? Omg, if you can't that would be more pseudocode.
