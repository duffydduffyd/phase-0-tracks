# 5.5 Solo Challenge: Manipulating Strings with Iteration 
# by Denise Duffy 11/22/16


real_name = "Denise Duffy"
# Downcase the name
# Swap first and last name.

flipped_name = real_name.split.rotate.join(" ").downcase # => "duffy denise"
p flipped_name

# Figure out how to get this into an array of characters: => ["d","u","f","f","y"," ","d","e","n","i","s","e"]
# No clear built in method to do this. Have tried converting it back to a string and .chars or .split it.

# Iterate with .map! and call a .next block method on the flipped name array



# Figure out how to convert 5 vowels





 # Change all letters to the next letter
def next_letter 
 	puts "hello"
end

next_letter

# example a.each {|x| print x, " -- " }


# real_name.each {|letter| letter.next }

# real_name.map do |encrypt|
# 	 	puts real_name.next
# end



# Change all the vowels to the next vowel
# An array of vowels, compare one array to another


# Upcase name

# If ! then add a space kind of thing
